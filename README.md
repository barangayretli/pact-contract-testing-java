# Pact Maven + Springboot + JUnit5 workshop

## Introduction

This workshop is aimed at demonstrating core features and benefits of contract testing with Pact.

Whilst contract testing can be applied retrospectively to systems, we will follow the [consumer driven contracts](https://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html) approach in this workshop - where a new consumer and provider are created in parallel to evolve a service over time, especially where there is some uncertainty with what is to be built.

This workshop should take from 1 to 2 hours, depending on how deep you want to go into each topic.

**Workshop outline**:

- [step 1: **create consumer**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step1#step-1---simple-consumer-calling-provider): Create our consumer before the Provider API even exists
- [step 2: **unit test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step2#step-2---client-tested-but-integration-fails): Write a unit test for our consumer
- [step 3: **pact test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step3#step-3---pact-to-the-rescue): Write a Pact test for our consumer
- [step 4: **pact verification**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step4#step-4---verify-the-provider): Verify the consumer pact with the Provider API
- [step 5: **fix consumer**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step5#step-5---back-to-the-client-we-go): Fix the consumer's bad assumptions about the Provider
- [step 6: **pact test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step6#step-6---consumer-updates-contract-for-missing-products): Write a pact test for `404` (missing User) in consumer
- [step 7: **provider states**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step7#step-7---adding-the-missing-states): Update API to handle `404` case
- [step 8: **pact test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step8#step-8---authorization): Write a pact test for the `401` case
- [step 9: **pact test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step9#step-9---implement-authorisation-on-the-provider): Update API to handle `401` case
- [step 10: **request filters**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step10#step-10---request-filters-on-the-provider): Fix the provider to support the `401` case
- [step 11: **pact broker**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step11#step-11---using-a-pact-broker): Implement a broker workflow for integration with CI/CD

_NOTE: Each step is tied to, and must be run within, a git branch, allowing you to progress through each stage incrementally. For example, to move to step 2 run the following: `git checkout step2`_

## Learning objectives

If running this as a team workshop format, you may want to take a look through the [learning objectives](./LEARNING.md).

## Requirements

- JDK 8 or above
- Maven 3
- Docker for step 11

## Scenario

There are two components in scope for our workshop.

1. Product Catalog website. It provides an interface to query the Product service for product information.
1. Product Service (Provider). Provides useful things about products, such as listing all products and getting the details of an individual product.

## Step 1 - Simple Consumer calling Provider

We need to first create an HTTP client to make the calls to our provider service:

![Simple Consumer](diagrams/workshop_step1.svg)

The Consumer has implemented the product service client which has the following:

- `GET /products` - Retrieve all products
- `GET /products/{id}` - Retrieve a single product by ID

The diagram below highlights the interaction for retrieving a product with ID 10:

![Sequence Diagram](diagrams/workshop_step1_class-sequence-diagram.svg)

You can see the service client interface we created in `consumer/src/main/java/io/pact/workshop/product_catalogue/clients/ProductServiceClient.java`:

```java
@Service
public class ProductServiceClient {
  @Autowired
  private RestTemplate restTemplate;

  @Value("${serviceClients.products.baseUrl}")
  private String baseUrl;

  public ProductServiceResponse fetchProducts() {
    return restTemplate.getForObject(baseUrl + "/products", ProductServiceResponse.class);
  }

  public Product fetchProductById(long id) {
    return restTemplate.getForObject(baseUrl + "/products/" + id, Product.class);
  }
}
```

After forking or cloning the repository, we need to build the app and install the dependencies. Run the following
in the `consumer` sub-directory:

```console
consumer ❯ ./mvnw verify
```

We can run the app with 

```console
consumer ❯ java -jar target/product-catalogue-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Accessing the URL for the app in the browser gives us a 500 error page as the downstream service is not running. 
You will also see an exception in the Springboot console output.

```
 I/O error on GET request for "http://localhost:9000/products": Connection refused
```

*Move on to [step 2](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step2#step-2---client-tested-but-integration-fails)*

## Step 2 - Client Tested but integration fails

Now let's create a basic test for our API client. We're going to check 2 things:

1. That our client code hits the expected endpoint
1. That the response is marshalled into an object that is usable, with the correct ID

You can see the client interface test we created in `consumer/src/test/java/io/pact/workshop/product_catalogue/clients/ProductServiceClientTest.java`:

```java
  @Test
  void getProductById(@Wiremock WireMockServer server, @WiremockUri String uri) {
      productServiceClient.setBaseUrl(uri);
      server.stubFor(
          get(urlPathEqualTo("/products/10"))
              .willReturn(aResponse()
              .withStatus(200)
              .withBody("{\n" +
                  "            \"id\": 50,\n" +
                  "            \"type\": \"CREDIT_CARD\",\n" +
                  "            \"name\": \"28 Degrees\",\n" +
                  "            \"version\": \"v1\"\n" +
                  "        }\n")
              .withHeader("Content-Type", "application/json"))
      );
    
      Product product = productServiceClient.getProductById(10);
      assertThat(product, is(equalTo(new Product(10L, "28 Degrees", "CREDIT_CARD", "v1"))));
  }
```

If you encounter failing tests after running `./mvnw verify`, make sure that the current branch is `step2`.

Meanwhile, our provider team has started building out their API in parallel. Let's run our website against our provider (you'll need two terminals to do this):

```

You should now see a screen showing 3 different products. There is a `Details ...` link which should display detailed product information.

Let's see what happens!

![Failed page](diagrams/workshop_step2_failed_page.png)

Doh! We are getting 500 everytime we try to view detailed product information. On closer inspection, 
we can see a 404 from the Product Service in the logs.

```
HttpClientErrorException$NotFound: 404 : [{"timestamp":"2021-02-25T05:27:51.264+00:00","status":404,"error":"Not Found","message":"","path":"/products/9"}]]
```

The issue is that the provider only knows about `/product/{id}` and `/products`.

We need to have a conversation about what the endpoint should be, but first...

*Move on to [step 3](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step3#step-3---pact-to-the-rescue)*

## Step 3 - Pact to the rescue

Unit tests are written and executed in isolation of any other services. When we write tests for code that talk to
other services, they are built on trust that the contracts are upheld. There is no way to validate that the 
consumer and provider can communicate correctly.

> An integration contract test is a test at the boundary of an external service verifying that it meets the 
> contract expected by a consuming service — [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/IntegrationContractTest.html)

Adding contract tests via Pact would have highlighted the `/product/{id}` endpoint was incorrect.

Let us add Pact to the project and write a consumer pact test for the `GET /products/{id}` endpoint.

*Provider states* is an important concept of Pact that we need to introduce. These states help define the state that the provider should be in for specific interactions. For the moment, we will initially be testing the following states:

- `product with ID 10 exists`
- `products exist`

The consumer can define the state of an interaction using the `given` property.

Pact test `consumer/src/test/java/io/pact/workshop/product_catalogue/clients/ProductServiceClientPactTest.java`:

```java
@SpringBootTest
@ExtendWith(PactConsumerTestExt.class)
@PactTestFor(providerName = "ProductService")
class ProductServiceClientPactTest {
  @Autowired
  private ProductServiceClient productServiceClient;

  @Pact(consumer = "ProductCatalogue")
  public RequestResponsePact allProducts(PactDslWithProvider builder) {
    return builder
      .given("products exists")
      .uponReceiving("get all products")
      .path("/products")
      .willRespondWith()
      .status(200)
      .body(
        new PactDslJsonBody()
          .minArrayLike("products", 1, 2)
          .integerType("id", 9L)
          .stringType("name", "Gem Visa")
          .stringType("type", "CREDIT_CARD")
          .closeObject()
          .closeArray()
      )
      .toPact();
  }

  @Pact(consumer = "ProductCatalogue")
  public RequestResponsePact singleProduct(PactDslWithProvider builder) {
    return builder
      .given("product with ID 10 exists", "id", 10)
      .uponReceiving("get product with ID 10")
      .path("/products/10")
      .willRespondWith()
      .status(200)
      .body(
        new PactDslJsonBody()
          .integerType("id", 10L)
          .stringType("name", "28 Degrees")
          .stringType("type", "CREDIT_CARD")
          .stringType("code", "CC_001")
          .stringType("version", "v1")
      )
      .toPact();
  }

  @Test
  @PactTestFor(pactMethod = "allProducts", port="9999")
  void testAllProducts(MockServer mockServer) throws IOException {
    productServiceClient.setBaseUrl(mockServer.getUrl());
    List<Product> products = productServiceClient.fetchProducts().getProducts();
    assertThat(products, hasSize(2));
    assertThat(products.get(0), is(equalTo(new Product(9L, "Gem Visa", "CREDIT_CARD", null, null))));
  }

  @Test
  @PactTestFor(pactMethod = "singleProduct", port="9999")
  void testSingleProduct(MockServer mockServer) throws IOException {
    Product product = productServiceClient.getProductById(10L);
    assertThat(product, is(equalTo(new Product(10L, "28 Degrees", "CREDIT_CARD", "v1", "CC_001"))));
  }
}
```


![Test using Pact](diagrams/workshop_step3_pact.svg)

These tests starts a mock server on a random port that acts as our provider service. To get this to work we update the 
URL in the `ProductServiceClient` to point to the mock server that Pact provides for the test.

Running this test also passes, but it creates a pact file which we can use to validate our assumptions on the 
provider side, and have conversation around.

A pact file should have been generated in *consumer/target/pacts/ProductCatalogue-ProductService.json*

*NOTE*: even if the API client had been graciously provided for us by our Provider Team, it doesn't mean that we 
shouldn't write contract tests - because the version of the client we have may not always be in sync with the 
deployed API - and also because we will write tests on the output appropriate to our specific needs.

*Move on to [step 4](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step4#step-4---verify-the-provider)*

## Step 4 - Verify the provider

We will need to copy the Pact contract file that was produced from the consumer test into the Provider module. 
This will help us verify that the provider can meet the requirements as set out in the contract.

Copy the contract located in `consumer/target/pacts/ProductCatalogue-ProductService.json` to `provider/pacts/ProductCatalogue-ProductService.json`.

Now let's make a start on writing a Pact test to validate the consumer contract:

In `provider/src/test/java/io/pact/workshop/product_service/PactVerificationTest.java`:

```java
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@Provider("ProductService")
@PactFolder("pacts")
@IgnoreMissingStateChange
public class PactVerificationTest {
  @LocalServerPort
  private int port;

  @Autowired
  private ProductRepository productRepository;

  @BeforeEach
  void setup(PactVerificationContext context) {
    context.setTarget(new HttpTestTarget("localhost", port));
  }

  @TestTemplate
  @ExtendWith(PactVerificationInvocationContextProvider.class)
  void pactVerificationTestTemplate(PactVerificationContext context) {
    context.verifyInteraction();
  }
}
```

This is a Springboot test that starts the app on a random port, and then injects the port into the test class.
We then setup the test context using some annotations on the test class that tells the Pact framework who the
provider is and where the pact files are. We also set the test target to point to the running app.

We now need to validate the pact generated by the consumer is valid by running the test, which should fail:

```console
provider ❯ ./mvnw verify

<<< Omitted >>>

1) Verifying a pact between ProductCatalogue and ProductService - get product with ID 10: has status code 200

    1.1) status: expected status of 200 but was 404

    1.2) body: $ Expected code='CC_001' but was missing

        {
        -  "code": "CC_001",
        -  "id": 10,
        -  "name": "28 Degrees",
        -  "type": "CREDIT_CARD",
        -  "version": "v1"
        +  "timestamp": "2021-02-26T02:50:41.293+00:00",
        +  "status": 404,
        +  "error": "Not Found",
        +  "message": "",
        +  "path": "/products/10"
        }

<<< Omitted >>>
    
```

![Pact Verification](diagrams/workshop_step4_pact.svg)

The test has failed, as the expected path `/products/{id}` is returning 404. We incorrectly believed our provider was following a RESTful design, but the authors were too lazy to implement a better routing solution 🤷🏻‍♂️.

The correct endpoint which the consumer should call is `/product/{id}`.

Move on to [step 5](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step5#step-5---back-to-the-client-we-go)

## Step 5 - Back to the client we go

We now need to update the consumer client and tests to hit the correct product path.

First, we need to update the GET route for the client:

In `consumer/src/main/java/io/pact/workshop/product_catalogue/clients/ProductServiceClient.java`:

```java
  public Product getProductById(long id) {
    return restTemplate.getForObject(baseUrl + "/product/" + id, Product.class);
  }
```

Then we need to update the Pact test `ID 10 exists` to use the correct endpoint in `path`.

In `consumer/src/test/java/io/pact/workshop/product_catalogue/clients/ProductServiceClientPactTest.java`:

```java
  @Pact(consumer = "ProductCatalogue")
  public RequestResponsePact singleProduct(PactDslWithProvider builder) {
    return builder
      .given("product with ID 10 exists", "id", 10)
      .uponReceiving("get product with ID 10")
        .path("/product/10")
      .willRespondWith()
        .status(200)
        .body(
          new PactDslJsonBody()
            .integerType("id", 10L)
            .stringType("name", "28 Degrees")
            .stringType("type", "CREDIT_CARD")
            .stringType("code", "CC_001")
            .stringType("version", "v1")
        )
      .toPact();
  }
```

![Pact Verification](diagrams/workshop_step5_pact.svg)

Let's run and generate an updated pact file on the consumer:

```console
consumer ❯ ./mvnw verify

<<< Omitted >>>

[INFO] 
[INFO] Results:

```

Now we run the provider tests again with the updated contract

Copy the updated contract located in `consumer/target/pacts/ProductCatalogue-ProductService.json` to `provider/pacts`.

Run the command:

```console
provider ❯ ./mvnw verify

<<< Omitted >>>

Yay - green ✅!

Move on to [step 6](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step6#step-6---consumer-updates-contract-for-missing-products)

## Step 6 - Consumer updates contract for missing products

We're now going to add 2 more scenarios for the contract

- What happens when we make a call for a product that doesn't exist? We assume we'll get a `404`.

- What happens when we make a call for getting all products but none exist at the moment? We assume a `200` with an empty array.

Let's write a test for these scenarios, and then generate an updated pact file.

In `consumer/src/test/java/io/pact/workshop/product_catalogue/clients/ProductServiceClientPactTest.java`:

```java
  @Pact(consumer = "ProductCatalogue")
  public RequestResponsePact noProducts(PactDslWithProvider builder) {
    return builder
      .given("no products exists")
      .uponReceiving("get all products")
        .path("/products")
      .willRespondWith()
        .status(200)
        .body(
          new PactDslJsonBody().array("products")
        )
      .toPact();
  }

  @Test
  @PactTestFor(pactMethod = "noProducts")
  void testNoProducts(MockServer mockServer) {
    productServiceClient.setBaseUrl(mockServer.getUrl());
    ProductServiceResponse products = productServiceClient.fetchProducts();
    assertThat(products.getProducts(), hasSize(0));
  }

  @Pact(consumer = "ProductCatalogue")
  public RequestResponsePact singleProductNotExists(PactDslWithProvider builder) {
    return builder
      .given("product with ID 10 does not exist", "id", 10)
      .uponReceiving("get product with ID 10")
        .path("/product/10")
      .willRespondWith()
        .status(404)
      .toPact();
  }

  @Test
  @PactTestFor(pactMethod = "singleProductNotExists")
  void testSingleProductNotExists(MockServer mockServer) {
    productServiceClient.setBaseUrl(mockServer.getUrl());
    try {
      productServiceClient.getProductById(10L);
      fail("Expected service call to throw an exception");
    } catch (HttpClientErrorException ex) {
      assertThat(ex.getMessage(), containsString("404 Not Found"));
    }
  }
```

Notice that our new tests look almost identical to our previous tests, and only differ on the expectations of the 
_response_ - the HTTP request expectations are exactly the same.

```console
consumer ❯ ./mvnw verify

<<< Omitted >>>

Failures:

1) Verifying a pact between ProductCatalogue and ProductService - get product with ID 10: has status code 404

    1.1) status: expected status of 404 but was 200

```

We expected this failure, because the product we are requesting does in fact exist! What we want to test for, 
is what happens if there is a different *state* on the Provider. This is what is referred to as "Provider states", 
and how Pact gets around test ordering and related issues.

We could resolve this by updating our consumer test to use a known non-existent product, but it's worth understanding
how Provider states work more generally.

*Move on to [step 7](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step7#step-7---adding-the-missing-states)*

## Step 7 - Adding the missing states

We need to update our provider code to deal with missing products and send a `404` response. However, our test data 
fixture also has product ID 10 and 11 in our database.

In this step, we will add some state handlers to our provider Pact verification test, which will update the state 
of our data store depending on which states the consumers require.

States are invoked prior to the actual test function is invoked. For each interaction in a pact file, the order of execution is as follows:

```
BeforeEach -> StateHandler (setup) -> RequestFilter -> Execute Provider Test -> StateHandler (teardown) -> AfterEach
```

We're going to add handlers for all our states:

- products exist
- no products exist
- product with ID 10 exists
- product with ID 10 does not exist

Let's open up our provider Pact verification test in `provider/src/test/java/io/pact/workshop/product_service/PactVerificationTest.java`:

```java
  @State(value = "products exists", action = StateChangeAction.SETUP)
  void productsExists() {
    productRepository.deleteAll();
    productRepository.saveAll(Arrays.asList(
      new Product(100L, "Test Product 1", "CREDIT_CARD", "v1", "CC_001"),
      new Product(200L, "Test Product 2", "CREDIT_CARD", "v1", "CC_002"),
      new Product(300L, "Test Product 3", "PERSONAL_LOAN", "v1", "PL_001"),
      new Product(400L, "Test Product 4", "SAVINGS", "v1", "SA_001")
    ));
  }

  @State(value = "no products exists", action = StateChangeAction.SETUP)
  void noProductsExist() {
    productRepository.deleteAll();
  }

  @State(value = "product with ID 10 exists", action = StateChangeAction.SETUP)
  void productExists(Map<String, Object> params) {
    long productId = ((Number) params.get("id")).longValue();
    Optional<Product> product = productRepository.findById(productId);
    if (!product.isPresent()) {
      productRepository.save(new Product(productId, "Product", "TYPE", "v1", "001"));
    }
  }

  @State(value = "product with ID 10 does not exist", action = StateChangeAction.SETUP)
  void productNotExist(Map<String, Object> params) {
    long productId = ((Number) params.get("id")).longValue();
    Optional<Product> product = productRepository.findById(productId);
    if (product.isPresent()) {
      productRepository.deleteById(productId);
    }
  }
```

Let's see how we go now:

```console
provider ❯ ./mvnw verify

<<< Omitted >>>

```

_NOTE_: The states are not necessarily a 1 to 1 mapping with the consumer contract tests. You can reuse states amongst 
different tests. In this scenario we could have used `no products exist` for both tests which would have 
equally been valid.

*Move on to [step 8](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step8#step-8---authorization)*

## Step 8 - Authorization

It turns out that not everyone should be able to use the API. After a discussion with the team, it was decided 
that a time-bound bearer token would suffice. The token must be base64 encoded format of a timestamp value and 
within 1 hour of the current time.

In the case a valid bearer token is not provided, we expect a `401`. Let's update the consumer to pass the 
bearer token, and capture this new `401` scenario.

In `consumer/src/main/java/io/pact/workshop/product_catalogue/clients/ProductServiceClient.java`:

```java
@Service
public class ProductServiceClient {
  @Autowired
  private RestTemplate restTemplate;

  @Value("${serviceClients.products.baseUrl}")
  private String baseUrl;

  public ProductServiceResponse fetchProducts() {
    return callApi("/products", ProductServiceResponse.class);
  }

  public Product getProductById(long id) {
    return callApi("/product/" + id, Product.class);
  }

  public String getBaseUrl() {
    return baseUrl;
  }

  public void setBaseUrl(String baseUrl) {
    this.baseUrl = baseUrl;
  }

  private <T> T callApi(String path, Class<T> responseType) {
    HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
    ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(Long.BYTES);
    buffer.putLong(System.currentTimeMillis());
    headers.setBearerAuth(Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(buffer.array()));
    HttpEntity<?> requestEntity = new HttpEntity<>(headers);
    return restTemplate.exchange(baseUrl + path, HttpMethod.GET, requestEntity, responseType).getBody();
  }
}
```

We add in `consumer/src/test/java/io/pact/workshop/product_catalogue/clients/ProductServiceClientPactTest.java`:

```java
    .matchHeader("Authorization", "Bearer [a-zA-Z0-9=\\+/]+", "Bearer AAABd9yHUjI=")
```

to all the interactions and two new interactions: 

```java
  @Pact(consumer = "ProductCatalogue")
  public RequestResponsePact noAuthToken(PactDslWithProvider builder) {
    return builder
      .uponReceiving("get all products with no auth token")
        .path("/products")
      .willRespondWith()
        .status(401)
      .toPact();
  }

  @Test
  @PactTestFor(pactMethod = "noAuthToken")
  void testNoAuthToken(MockServer mockServer) {
    productServiceClient.setBaseUrl(mockServer.getUrl());
    try {
      productServiceClient.fetchProducts();
      fail("Expected service call to throw an exception");
    } catch (HttpClientErrorException ex) {
      assertThat(ex.getMessage(), containsString("401 Unauthorized"));
    }
  }

  @Pact(consumer = "ProductCatalogue")
  public RequestResponsePact noAuthToken2(PactDslWithProvider builder) {
    return builder
      .uponReceiving("get product by ID with no auth token")
        .path("/product/10")
      .willRespondWith()
        .status(401)
      .toPact();
  }

  @Test
  @PactTestFor(pactMethod = "noAuthToken2")
  void testNoAuthToken2(MockServer mockServer) {
    productServiceClient.setBaseUrl(mockServer.getUrl());
    try {
      productServiceClient.getProductById(10L);
      fail("Expected service call to throw an exception");
    } catch (HttpClientErrorException ex) {
      assertThat(ex.getMessage(), containsString("401 Unauthorized"));
    }
  }
```

Then re-run the Pact test to generate a new Pact file.

Let's test the provider. Copy the updated pact file into the provider's pact directory and run the tests:

```console
provider ❯ ./mvnw verify

<<< Omitted >>>

[ERROR] Tests run: 6, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 4.631 s <<< FAILURE! - in io.pact.workshop.product_service.PactVerificationTest

```

Now with the most recently added interactions where we are expecting a response of 401, but the provider is not handling 
any authentication, so we are getting 200...

*Move on to [step 9](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step9#step-9---implement-authorisation-on-the-provider)*

## Step 9 - Implement authorisation on the provider

We will setup Spring Security to check the Authorization header and deny the request with `401` if the token is 
missing or older than 1 hour.

In `provider/src/main/java/io/pact/workshop/product_service/config/BearerAuthorizationFilter.java`

```java
public class BearerAuthorizationFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {

  public static final long ONE_HOUR = 60 * 60 * 1000L;

  @Override
  protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain filterChain) throws ServletException, IOException {
    String header = request.getHeader("Authorization");
    if (tokenValid(header)) {
      SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(new PreAuthenticatedAuthenticationToken("user", header));
      filterChain.doFilter(request, response);
    } else {
      response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_UNAUTHORIZED);
    }
  }

  private boolean tokenValid(String header) {
    boolean hasBearerToken = StringUtils.isNotEmpty(header) && header.startsWith("Bearer ");
    if (hasBearerToken) {
      String token = header.substring("Bearer ".length());
      ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(Long.BYTES);
      buffer.put(Base64.getDecoder().decode(token));
      buffer.flip();
      long timestamp = buffer.getLong();
      return System.currentTimeMillis() - timestamp <= ONE_HOUR;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }
}
```

Let's test this out:

```console
provider ❯ ./mvnw verify

<<< Omitted >>>

Oh, dear. _More_ tests are failing. Can you understand why?

*Move on to [step 10](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step10#step-10---request-filters-on-the-provider)*

## Step 10 - Request Filters on the Provider

Because our pact file has static data in it, our bearer token is now out of date, so when Pact verification 
passes it to the Provider we get a `401`. There are multiple ways to resolve this - mocking or stubbing out 
the authentication component is a common one. In our use case, we are going to use a process referred to as 
_Request Filtering_, by modifying the request that gets sent.

_NOTE_: This is an advanced concept and should be used carefully, as it has the potential to invalidate a 
contract by bypassing its constraints. See https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-jvm/blob/master/provider/junit5/README.md#modifying-the-requests-before-they-are-sent 
for more details on this.

The approach we are going to take to inject the header is as follows:

1. If we receive any Authorization header, we override the incoming request with a valid (in time) Authorization header, and continue with whatever call was being made
1. If we don't receive an Authorization header, we do nothing

_NOTE_: We are not considering the `403` scenario in this example.

In `provider/src/test/java/io/pact/workshop/product_service/PactVerificationTest.java`:

```java
  @TestTemplate
  @ExtendWith(PactVerificationInvocationContextProvider.class)
  void pactVerificationTestTemplate(PactVerificationContext context, HttpRequest request) {
    // WARNING: Do not modify anything else on the request, because you could invalidate the contract
    if (request.containsHeader("Authorization")) {
      request.setHeader("Authorization", "Bearer " + generateToken());
    }
    context.verifyInteraction();
  }

  private static String generateToken() {
    ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(Long.BYTES);
    buffer.putLong(System.currentTimeMillis());
    return Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(buffer.array());
  }
```

We can now run the Provider tests

```console
provider ❯ ./mvnw verify

<<< Omitted >>>

*Move on to [step 11](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5/tree/step11#step-11---using-a-pact-broker)*

## Step 11 - Using a Pact Broker

![Broker collaboration Workflow](diagrams/workshop_step10_broker.svg)

We've been publishing our pacts from the consumer project by essentially sharing the file system with the 
provider. But this is not very manageable when you have multiple teams contributing to the code base, and 
pushing to CI. We can use a [Pact Broker](https://pactflow.io) to do this instead.

Using a broker simplifies the management of pacts and adds a number of useful features, including some safety
enhancements for continuous delivery which we'll see shortly.

In this workshop we will be using the open source Pact broker.

### Running the Pact Broker with docker-compose

In the root directory, run:

```console
 ❯ docker-compose up
```

### Publish contracts from consumer

First, in the consumer project we need to tell Pact about our broker. We will use the Pact Maven plugin to
manage this. 

In `consumer/pom.xml`:

```xml
<build>
  <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
          <groupId>au.com.dius.pact.provider</groupId>
          <artifactId>maven</artifactId>
          <version>4.1.17</version>
          <configuration>
            <pactBrokerUrl>http://localhost:9292</pactBrokerUrl>
            <pactBrokerUsername>pact_workshop</pactBrokerUsername>
            <pactBrokerPassword>pact_workshop</pactBrokerPassword>
          </configuration>
      </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```

And now we can run:

```console
consumer ❯ ./mvnw pact:publish
[INFO] Scanning for projects...
[INFO] 
[INFO] -----------------< io.pact.workshop:product-catalogue >-----------------
[INFO] Building product-catalogue 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT

[INFO] Total time:  0.745 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2021-03-01T09:51:29+11:00
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Have a browse around the broker on http://localhost:9292 (with username/password: `pact_workshop`/`pact_workshop`) and see your newly published contract!

### Verify contracts on Provider

All we need to do for the provider is update the test where it finds its pacts, from local URLs, to one from a broker.
We add a `@PactBroker` annotation to our test and change it to use the `PactVerificationSpringProvider`, 
and then create a test application YAML configuration file with the details of the Pact Broker.

In `provider/src/test/java/io/pact/workshop/product_service/PactVerificationTest.java`:

```java
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@Provider("ProductService")
@PactBroker // <--
public class PactVerificationTest {
  @LocalServerPort
  private int port;

  @Autowired
  private ProductRepository productRepository;

  @BeforeEach
  void setup(PactVerificationContext context) {
    context.setTarget(new HttpTestTarget("localhost", port));
  }

  @TestTemplate
  @ExtendWith(PactVerificationSpringProvider.class) // <--
  void pactVerificationTestTemplate(PactVerificationContext context, HttpRequest request) {
    // WARNING: Do not modify anything else on the request, because you could invalidate the contract
    if (request.containsHeader("Authorization")) {
      request.setHeader("Authorization", "Bearer " + generateToken());
    }
    context.verifyInteraction();
  }  

```

and then create `provider/src/test/resources/application.yml`:

```yaml
pactbroker:
  host: localhost
  port: "9292"
  auth:
    username: pact_workshop
    password: pact_workshop
```

Let's run the provider verification one last time after this change:

```console
provider ❯ ./mvnw verify -Dpact.verifier.publishResults=true -Dpact.provider.version=1.0-SNAPSHOT

<<< Omitted >>>

```

As part of this process, the results of the verification - the outcome (boolean) and the detailed information 
about the failures at the interaction level - are published to the Broker also.

This is one of the Broker's more powerful features. Referred to as [Verifications](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/advanced_topics/provider_verification_results), 
it allows providers to report back the status of a verification to the broker. You'll get a quick view of the 
status of each consumer and provider on a nice dashboard. But it is much more important than this!

### Can I deploy?

With just a simple use of the `pact-broker` [can-i-deploy tool](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/advanced_topics/provider_verification_results) - 
the Broker will determine if a consumer or provider is safe to release to the specified environment.

You can run the `can-i-deploy` checks as follows:

```console
consumer ❯ ./mvnw pact:can-i-deploy -Dpacticipant='ProductCatalogue' -Dlatest=true
